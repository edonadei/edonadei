### What i like 🎉

Big fan of big automated and self-healing infrastructures, and injecting chaos into it 💥💥💥
But i love to build web products with it, because it's always more convenient to look at when you have a great interface attached to it.

### Where i work 📝

Currently working at SAP, on improving an internal CI/CD product formalizing the builds for more that 13 000 developers

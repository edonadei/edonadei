### Who am i 👀

Hello, i'm edonadei A.K.A Emrick DONADEI, and Github is my playground to experiment and try out new ideas, feel free to browse !

### What i like 🎉

Big fan of big automated and self-healing infrastructures, and injecting chaos into it 💥💥💥
But i love to build web products with it, because it's always more convenient to look at when you have a great interface attached to it.

### Where i work 📝
